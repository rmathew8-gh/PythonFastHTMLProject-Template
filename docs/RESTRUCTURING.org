# Project Restructuring: src/ Layout

## Overview
Restructured the project to use a `src/` folder layout for better organization and scalability.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure
- Created `src/agno_trials/` package directory
- Moved `app.py` to `src/agno_trials/app.py`
- Added `src/agno_trials/__init__.py` with package metadata

### Configuration Updates
- Updated `pyproject.toml`:
  - Changed package path to `src/agno_trials`
  - Added hatch environment configuration
- Updated `Makefile`:
  - Changed uvicorn module reference from `app:app` to `agno_trials.app:app`
  - Updated coverage targets to use `agno_trials` package

### Test Updates
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` import from `app` to `agno_trials.app`
- Updated `tests/test_integration.py` file structure test to check new path

### Benefits
- Clear separation between source code and project files
- Better import handling and package boundaries
- Easier to add new modules and subpackages
- Industry-standard Python project structure
- Improved scalability for future growth

## Verification
- All tests pass (56 passed, 1 skipped)
- Application runs correctly with `make dev`
- Linting passes without errors
- Coverage reporting works with new package structure
