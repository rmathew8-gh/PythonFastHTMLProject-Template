* Test Suite

** Structure

- *conftest.py*: Shared fixtures and utilities
- *test_app.py*: Unit tests (29 tests) - fast feedback during development
- *test_integration.py*: Integration tests (28 tests) - end-to-end validation

** Running Tests

#+begin_src bash
make test           # All tests
make test-unit      # Unit tests only (fast)
make test-integration # Integration tests only
make test-coverage  # With coverage report
make test-verbose   # Verbose output
#+end_src

** Test Categories

*** Unit Tests (test_app.py)
- Root endpoint functionality
- HTTP method validation and error handling  
- HTML structure and content validation
- Response headers and FastHTML rendering
- CSS styling and content validation

*** Integration Tests (test_integration.py)
- End-to-end application workflow
- Static file serving and system behavior
- HTML semantics and accessibility
- FastHTML integration features
- System integration (concurrency, memory, error recovery)

** Coverage
- 85% code coverage
- HTML rendering and structure
- FastHTML component integration
- HTTP status codes and headers
- Static file serving
- Error handling and performance

** Adding Tests

*Unit tests*: Focus on individual components, keep fast
*Integration tests*: Test complete workflows and system behavior
*Shared utilities*: Add common fixtures to conftest.py

Use pytest fixtures and shared assertion functions from conftest.py.
